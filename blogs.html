          Introduction: In the discussion below, I will be analysing what data
          visualisation is as well as the important role it serves in a society
          with developing technology that is constantly improving.
        </p>

        <p id="post">
          What is data visualisation? The reading ‘Overview of Data
          Visualisation’ by Li states several varying definitions of data
          visualisation showcasing that it is a broad term. My understanding of
          the reading has led me to realise that data visualisation is when data
          is taken and reproduced into some type of visual form so that the
          receivers of the data may truly understand what the data represents
          thereby increasing cognition. (Li 2020: 18-19) The representation of
          data visually simplifies it for the reader by decreasing the
          overbearing load of information that they would have had to struggle
          to understand if it was not done in a visual manner/form. Not only
          does this increase readability but it also enhances understanding and
          accessibility of the data. Data visualisation makes use of visual
          elements like tables, charts, graphs, and maps to convey data in a way
          that makes the information clear and effective in what it represents
          so that the reader may gain insight and identify patterns within the
          data. Data visualisation is highly significant in a number of fields
          like science, academia, business and many more showing its popularity
          in differing industries. (Li 2020: 18-19) What are the two types of
          data visualisation? Data visualisation branches into two types or
          fields namely information visualisation and scientific visualisation.
          These may be two types of data visualisation, but they still convert
          ‘’data into a visual form’’ so that the information being presented
          becomes understandable increasing the knowledge and insight gained
          from engaging with them. (Li 2020: 19) Information visualisation
          represents abstract data or knowledge in a visual form so that users
          gain a deeper understanding of it as well as can determine common
          patterns within the data thereby assisting them in making informed
          decisions using the data. Information data can be represented in
          several ways like tree maps, scatter plots, and tree diagrams. In
          information visualisation the content of the data should always be
          considered before deciding how to best represent it visually. This is
          so that the data becomes more effective and clearer for users.
          Scientific visualisation represents scientific data which usually
          centres around physicality like the human body. This type of
          visualisation is very important in validating scientific hypotheses as
          well as assisting people in communicating their ideas/findings more
          effectively. “Simulations, waveforms, or volume” are the ways in which
          scientific visualisation can be represented and these are usually done
          using 3D modelling. The reason for discussing the two fields of data
          visualisation was to show that it is a very flexible and broad term as
          it is used in two ways to represent data of two entirely different
          topics showing its capabilities in a range of fields. (Li 2020: 19-22)
          The importance of data visualisation and choosing the right form: From
          the above discussion it can be noted that data visualisation plays an
          important role in many fields in representing data so that users can
          easily grasp the concepts, patterns, and information that the data is
          addressing and providing. Data being visually appealing referring to
          how concise, and readable it is, heightens the retrieval of
          information as well as the impact it has on its users. This means that
          a larger group of users can understand what they are engaging with.
          Data can most definitely be represented as it is but that would
          increase difficulty, and indecisiveness of what the data is
          representing as well as creating an overbearing amount of information
          that the user will have to rummage through to understand what is
          happening. This can repel users and create more confusion than
          insight. Data visualisation is all about making information
          accessible, readable, and concise so that user’s cognition and
          understanding is enhanced. It is just as important to know what forms
          of data visualisation can be used for certain types of data as this
          also impacts how the data is received and read. Some of the forms of
          data visualisation include trees, maps, scatter plots, and charts.
          Each one more suitable for a specific kind of data. For example, trees
          are used to represent a hierarchical structure in data with its
          branches usually representing relationships that exist within the
          data. Alternatively, charts are useful in representing quantitative
          data like size and numbers. (Li 2020: 19-29)
        </p>
        <p id="post">
          Conclusion: Throughout the discussion, data visualisation has become a
          common concept as well as a significant one. The role it plays in
          creating data that is more accessible, visually stimulating, and
          easier to understand explains why it is so popular in several fields
          like business, science, journalism and more. Data visualisation
          communicates information drastically better between not only scholars
          but the public as well, ensuring that the people who need to know
          about the information and the people who want to know about the
          information are both equally aware of what the data is representing. A
          bonus aspect of data visualisation is that it allows for information
          to be visually pleasing to the human eye. This aspect assists people
          in grasping the concepts being displayed by the data while making it
          effortless to remember as people are drawn to what is visually
          pleasing. It can be compared to a person who retains information more
          successfully when studying through the use of visual stimuli like
          colour or little annotations because in both cases the visual aspect
          embeds the information while simplifying it when it is being
          processed.

        <p id="post2">
          Introduction: User interface and user experience are vital components
          when designing a website. Websites are platforms that are meant to be
          engaged with and should effectively inform the user about the main
          goals that the website should be serving. Therefore, it is necessary
          to keep the users who will be interacting with the website in mind
          when designing and building them. This will always allow a designer to
          remain consistent to the experience they want their user to have when
          traversing their website. In this blog post I will be critically
          analysing my own website to decipher where I succeeded and failed in
          the UI/UX aspects of my design.
        </p>
        <p id="post2">
          What is UI/UX design: What is UI design? UI stands for user interface
          design. This term is usually used interchangeably with user experience
          although they are completely different aspects that work
          simultaneously to create a cohesive website. UI design refers to the
          visual layout and interactive elements of a website that a user will
          have to engage with so that they may use the website to its full
          potential. (Lamprecht, 2023) It focuses on the feel and interactivity
          of a website ensuring that the product is as intuitive as possible.
          Therefore, each decision whether visual or interactive needs to be
          carefully considered because this will heighten the user experience.
          Examples of user interface include the colour scheme, imagery, spacing
          and responsive design. (Lamprecht, 2023) What is UX design? UX stands
          for user experience. This aspect of design follows suit of UI as it is
          a direct result/impact of how successfully the user interface was
          created. The user experience refers to the “interaction between the
          user and the product”, in this case a website. (Lamprecht, 2023) It
          encompasses all reactions, emotions, and satisfaction the interaction
          with the product/service evokes in the user. User experience design
          ensures that all the required elements to create a good user
          experience is present in the product/service. UX design aims to create
          products/services that are in alignment with the user’s goals and
          needs to create for a meaningful experience. (Lamprecht, 2023)
          Analysis of my website using UI/UX design principles: The website that
          I created for my first assignment was space themed because I am using
          a NASA API for the data visualization section of my website.
          Therefore, I thought reiterating the space theme throughout the
          website would reinforce the content behind the data visualization and
          users would not be confused when they reached that section of my
          website. The homepage: For the homepage of my website, I decided to
          implement a slideshow aspect because it would be easier and more
          efficient to navigate for the users rather than scrolling down through
          an overwhelming amount of content and information just to learn more
          about my website and each page. This excess information would increase
          cognitive load for the users causing their attention to stray because
          there would be too much information and content to process before they
          even venture through the other pages. Therefore, by using a slideshow
          with different space related images and providing a brief description
          of each page the cognitive load on the user is reduced and the
          navigation is more efficient as it allows the user to travel to the
          other pages that are more significant at a faster pace. The colours
          and backgrounds used on each page are the same to create a cohesive
          look throughout. This helps reinforce the idea that the website is one
          and that the content is all related by creating familiarity. I
          included a page number component so that when the user is navigating
          the slideshow, they are aware of what slide they are on. This allows
          the user to know where they currently are. (Singh, 2022)
        </p>
        <p id="post2">
          The Blog Page: The blog page consists of a very simple layout. As soon
          as the user enters the space they are presented with the blogs. This
          simple layout allows the user to receive the information that is
          necessary without having to go on a search for the blog they wish to
          read. This is an example of good UI because I have reduced the amount
          of work the user has to do to find my blogs. This means they can spend
          more time reading and understanding what my blogs are conveying.
          However, the font and colour of the font that I used appear to be
          difficult to read which would make the user strain their eyes just to
          decipher each word, therefore frustrating the user as they are
          requiring more effort to read the words than they need to. This
          decision could push the user to ignoring the content of the blogs
          altogether. The colour and style of the blocks that contain my blogs
          are the same to communicate to the user that what they are engaging
          with are blogs and not other types of written works. This helps the
          user avoid confusion by providing clarity that the elements on the
          page are similar. (Singh, 2022) The Design Page: The design page
          layout was designed with most important aspect being placed first
          which are the wireframes. This is the first aspect on the page as it
          allows the users to understand each visual and interactive decision I
          made for each page and why. This would equip the user with a better
          understanding of how to navigate each page as well as what they should
          pay attention to. When the user hovers over the wireframes they get
          highlighted which is good UI because it provides feedback to the user
          that they should click the image. If this was not highlighted the user
          may not have known, they could do so hindering their ability to view
          the wireframes at an enlarged ratio. The spacing between the elements
          on the page is good UI because it allows the user to differentiate
          between each element as well as know that each element represents a
          different part of the page. Therefore, the user does not have to use a
          lot of energy in determining what elements go together and if they are
          separate or a whole. This allows the user to effectively navigate
          through the design page knowing what they are consuming at each stage.
          (Singh, 2022)
        </p>

        <p id="post2">
          Conclusion: From the above discussion, I still need to improve my UI
          design elements to ensure for a better, meaningful user experience for
          the users. The elements are sufficient, but they can be improved upon
          so that the user experience is seamless and does not increase
          cognitive load but rather decreases it.
        </p>

        <h4>My Blog Post Three</h4>
        <p id="post3">
          Introduction: Interaction is a seemingly significant component of data
          visualisation as it adds another layer to it by allowing the
          user/person to receive some sort of feedback to highlight that their
          input was received or acknowledged by the system. Dimara and Perin’s
          reading ‘What is Interaction for Data Visualisation?’ draws attention
          to the vital role that the broad term interaction is plays in
          visualisation, specifically data visualisation. The reading showcases
          how complex and usually ill-defined the concept of interaction is as
          well as how it differs in various contexts like HCI compared to data
          visualisation. Data visualisation is when data is taken and reproduced
          into some type of visual form so that the receivers of the data may
          truly understand what the data represents thereby increasing
          cognition. (Li 2020: 18-19) Interaction in the realm of visualisation
          as defined by Dimara and Perin is the connection between user/person
          and the data interface that results in an action by the user which is
          registered by the system thereby returning a reaction allowing the
          user to see and grasp that their action was met with some sort of
          feedback from the visualisation system. (Dimara & Perin 2019)
        </p>

        <p id="post3">
          Interaction for HCI and Data Visualisation: In the reading, Dimara and
          Perin compare how interaction is different in the realm of HCI
          compared to the realm of data visualization. This contrast emphasizes
          how the term interaction is quite broad in what it describes as well
          as how it is used and defined in different contexts. However, it helps
          develop an understanding of interaction specifically related to
          visualization. Interaction for Human-computer Interaction (HCI) As
          mentioned above the reading highlights the many differences between
          the concept of interaction between HCI and data visualization. One of
          the more significant differences is that interaction in HCI requires
          the user and the computer alongside the dialogue that ensues between
          the two to result in an action-reaction state. The interaction for HCI
          does not require the data component that interaction for visualization
          requires. The reading mentions several components that interaction for
          HCI requires. For example, two important components required for HCI
          interaction that are not considered in interaction for visualization
          is embodiment and experience (user). (Dimara & Perin 2019) Embodiment
          allows the user to feel and believe that the technology is a part of
          them and not a separate entity. This creates a seamlessness within how
          the user interacts with the technology and registers the interaction.
          “Embodiment hones in on the experience the user has and how that is
          applied to the interaction and actions being coupled with contexts.”
          This description from the reading explains a significant difference
          between interaction for HCI and interaction for visualization because
          it shows how in the context of HCI the user’s experience is quite
          important in determining how their interaction and actions with the
          technology is processed and understood. (Dimara & Perin 2019)
          Experience is like embodiment in that it focuses on the psychological
          needs of the user and plays on those needs to create an impactful user
          experience thereby placing heavy importance on human experience to
          draw out those emotions and understanding as well as using aesthetics
          as an advantage to create a deeper impact on the user. Experience in
          interaction for HCI concentrates more on creating pleasure within the
          user and assisting them in deriving meaning from their interaction
          rather than efficiency and ability. (Dimara & Perin 2019) For example,
          if a user clicks a button and a little animation ensues to give
          feedback to them, the animation is mainly there for the user to
          enjoy/get excited about which creates that feeling of pleasure because
          it feels like they are being rewarded for performing the action.
          (Elmqvist et al. 2011) Despite the visible differences present between
          interaction for HCI and interaction for visualization, understanding
          interaction for HCI paves the way to understand how interaction for
          visualization works specifically in that context. Interaction for data
          visualization/visualization To define interaction in visualization,
          the reading highlights the key differences between visualization and
          HCI focusing on entities, flexibility, intent, and focus. These key
          differences assist in formulating the definition of interaction in
          visualization that was discussed in the introduction of this blog
          post. Entities in HCI only involve the engagement of human and
          computer while in visualization, a data entity is needed which leads
          to the engagement of human, computer and data with the computer being
          the platform on which the user can interact with the data. (Dimara &
          Perin 2019) For example, the user pressing a button to go to a new
          page on a website could be considered engagement between user and
          computer while a user mousing over a bubble in a bubble graph to show
          the name and population of a country would be the user interacting
          with the data through the computer. (Elmqvist et al. 2011) Performance
          focus in HCI strives to have tools that are easy and understandable to
          use creating a seamless and effortless user experience. In contrast,
          visualization overlooks user experience and therefore mainly aims at
          trying to help the user in understanding and grasping the data that
          they are interacting with. Therefore, requiring more effort and time
          from the user to carefully go through the data to develop a greater
          understanding of it. (Dimara & Perin 2019) However, for the user to
          understand that their engagement with the visualization is being
          registered immediate visual feedback should be given to the user so
          that they can know that an interaction is taking place because of
          their action. For example, all aspects that are clickable and display
          extra information should be highlighted when the mouse moves over it
          so that the user knows that they can click it and learn more about the
          data. (Elmqvist et al. 2011) Although interaction for HCI assists in
          understanding interaction for visualization there are some aspects
          that cannot be explained or understood through the lens of interaction
          for HCI. This is because HCI and visualization still have differences
          that separate how interaction relates to them mainly because
          visualization contains the extra element of data. (Dimara & Perin
          2019)

          Conclusion: Interaction as mentioned above is a thoroughly broad term
          and serves a different purpose in relation to the context it is being
          used in. The comparison and contrast of interaction for HCI and
          interaction for data visualization shows how unique and similar the
          term of interaction can be. Therefore, understanding how interaction
          works within the context of HCI helped form understanding of how it
          works in the context of visualization as well as assisted in creating
          a working definition of interaction in the realm of visualization.
